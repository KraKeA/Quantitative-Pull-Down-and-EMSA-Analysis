# EMSA and Quantitative Pull-Down Analysis Tool

## About
This program is designed for the work with 
Electrophoretic Mobility Shift Assay (EMSA) 
or quantitative pull-down experiments. 
It offers a solution for analyzing experimental 
data, after digitalising the results by a picture,
to estimate dissociation constants (Kd) 
and visually represents the results through a 
modeled binding curve. Our tool simplifies 
the process of quantitatively evaluating 
binding affinities and interactions between molecules.

## Features
- **Data Import:** Easily import your experimental data in picture form.
- **Kd Estimation:** Calculation of the dissociation constant (Kd) from your EMSA or pull-down data.
- **Graphical Representation:** Automatically generate graphs displaying the experimental data along with a modeled binding curve for visual analysis.
- **Export Options:** Export your results and graphs for use in presentations, publications, or further analysis.
